"They tell me, "Keep it simple", I tell them, "Take it slow"
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them, "Take it easy", they laugh and tell me, "No"
It's cool but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I'm spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinnin' gold out my records, know you can't combat me" -My Ordinary Life (The Living Tombstone)
